# Learning Game Development, ECS and Rust

This repository contains the code I write while learning game development, ECS architectures and Rust. I have no experience in any of these things, so don't expect this code to be of very high quality.

The game logic and assets are all based on [CS50's Introduction to Game Development](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50G+Games/course/) course on edX.

My goal is to implement all the 2D games (lecture 1-7) from that course in Rust using the [GGEZ](https://ggez.rs/) game engine and the [Specs ECS](https://specs.amethyst.rs/) library. The main reason I am doing this is to teach myself both the Rust language and ECS architectures in general.

## Implemented GD50 games
- [x] Pong
- [ ] Flappy Bird
- [ ] Breakout
- [ ] Match 3
- [ ] Super Mario Bros
- [ ] Legend of Zelda
- [ ] Angry Birds
- [ ] Pokemon

## Other things I would like to learn and implement
- [ ] Hot reloading of assets
- [ ] Placeholder for so many things... :)
